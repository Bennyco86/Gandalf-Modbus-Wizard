**Gandalf Modbus Wizard** is a free utility designed to help you scan, troubleshoot, and simulate **Modbus TCP** and **Modbus RTU** devices.

*Designed by an engineer, for engineers—to take the guesswork out of serial communications.*

## 🐧 Big News — Linux Support (v1.12)
Gandalf Modbus Wizard is now **officially supported on Linux** 🎉  
Starting with **v1.12**, you can install it via a `.deb` package:

- ✅ **Linux installer:** `gandalf-modbus-wizard_1.12_amd64.deb`
- 📦 Download it from the **v1.12 Release** page:
  👉 https://github.com/Bennyco86/Gandalf-Modbus-Wizard/releases/tag/v1.12

## ✨ Features

### 📈 Live Trend Analysis (New!)
Visualize your data in real-time to diagnose stability issues or tune loops.
* **Real-time Graphing:** Select specific registers to plot values instantly.
* **PID Tuning Helper:** Perfect for visualizing PV (Process Variable), SP (Setpoint), and OP (Output) simultaneously.
* **Dynamic Theme:** Charts automatically adapt to Dark Mode.

---

### 🔍 Auto Detection Wizard
Stop guessing your connection settings. This feature brute-forces combinations to automatically detect the correct parameters for your Modbus RTU device.
* **COM Port:** Select your target port.
* **Scan Range:** Define the Device ID range to probe.
* **Parameters:** Automatically cycles through Baud Rates, Parities, Data Bits, and Stop Bits.

---

### 🔌 Modbus RTU Scanner
Once your connection is established, use the RTU Scanner to visualize data.
* **Relaxed Timing:** Now supports **1.5 Stop Bits** for improved stability with Arduino/Embedded devices.
* **Control:** Write directly to registers from the interface.
* **Visuals:** Combine consecutive registers (Normal / Reverse) for 32-bit values.

---

### 🌐 Modbus TCP Scanner
Connect to and diagnose Modbus devices over a network.
* **Connection:** Localhost or target IP (Default Port 502).
* **Flexibility:** Custom polling rates and Start / End address ranges.
* **Data Formatting:** Combined registers in Normal or Reverse order.
* **RTU over TCP (RTU Tunnel):** For “transparent” gateways that tunnel RTU frames over a TCP socket (e.g., Waveshare-style setups).

---

### 🎮 Modbus Simulation
Need to test a SCADA or HMI client? Spin up a virtual device instantly.
* **Robust Engine:** Completely rewritten threaded engine to prevent stalls.
* **Manual Overrides:** Writing to a register now "Locks" the value (indicated by `[LOCKED]`), preventing the auto-generator from overwriting your test data.
* **Simulation:** Generates valid Modbus responses for client testing.

## 🚀 What's New in Version 1.12

📌 **Release link (v1.12):**  
👉 https://github.com/Bennyco86/Gandalf-Modbus-Wizard/releases/tag/v1.12

### Highlights

🔁 **RTU over TCP (RTU Tunnel)**  
Added **RTU-over-TCP** support to the **Modbus TCP Scanner** — useful for gateways that tunnel raw RTU frames through a TCP socket (often called *Transparent Mode*).
- Full **scan + write** support
- Works alongside standard **Modbus TCP (MBAP)** mode

🎛️ **Transport / Framing Selector**  
The TCP Scanner now lets you choose:
- **Modbus TCP (MBAP)**
- **RTU over TCP (RTU Tunnel)**

🧪 **Local Test Helper Included**  
Added an **RTU-over-TCP proxy helper** so you can test RTU-over-TCP locally using the built-in Modbus TCP simulator.
- Includes a step-by-step guide: **RTU_OVER_TCP_TESTING.md**

🐧 **Official Linux Support (New!)**  
Gandalf now ships with a **Linux `.deb` installer**:
- `gandalf-modbus-wizard_1.12_amd64.deb`

---

## 🚀 What's New in Version 1.11

📌 **Release link (v1.11):**  
👉 https://github.com/Bennyco86/Gandalf-Modbus-Wizard/releases/tag/v1.11

### Major Features

🎨 **Futuristic UI Overhaul**  
Migrated to a modern flat UI with a cleaner layout, smoother scaling, and a seamless **Dark/Light** theme.  
Also includes **DPI-aware** behavior for sharp rendering on high-DPI displays.

📡 **New Network Diagnostics Tab**  
Built-in tools to help when you’re chasing comms issues:
- **Traffic Monitor (Packet Sniffer):** view raw Modbus hex traffic in real-time with a high-performance rolling log
- **CRC16 Calculator:** manually verify checksums for firmware/debugging work

🔍 **Enhanced Auto-Detection**  
Improved algorithms for Arduino and embedded device boot timing quirks — faster and more reliable when trying to find that “lost” baud rate.

💾 **Save Your Config**  
Save and load RTU connection settings to **JSON**, making it easy to swap between multiple field devices without re-entering parameters.

## 🚀 What's New in Version 1.10

### Major Features

📈 **Live Trend Graphing**  
Added a popup real-time chart. Select any rows in the scanner grid and click **"Trend Selected"** to visualize data over time. Handy for diagnosing intermittent sensor issues or PID loop behavior.

📊 **Excel Export with Charts**  
Export your scan history directly to an Excel file. The wizard now automatically generates a line chart for the first 15 registers in your log!

📦 **Full Windows Application**  
Gandalf has graduated to a standalone Windows Application. The installer handles all dependencies—no Python knowledge required.

### Fixes & Improvements

🛡️ **Simulation Race Condition Fix**  
Rewrote the Simulation Server to use **Thread Locking**. This eliminates the "Input/Output" error and application stall that occurred when writing values to the simulator during a scan.

🔌 **RTU Stability Update**  
Added support for **1.5 Stop Bits** logic. This fixes framing errors and connection drops commonly seen with Arduino, ESP32, and other embedded Modbus slaves that have slight timing jitters.

✍️ **Float Value Support**  
Fixed an issue where writing Float values to registers was not parsing correctly. You can now write 32-bit floating point numbers to supported devices seamlessly.

🌙 **Dynamic Dark Mode**  
The Live Trend charts now respect the global Dark Mode setting, switching to a dark background and white axis text automatically.
