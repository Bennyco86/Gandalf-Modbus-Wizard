## ✨ Features

### 📈 Live Trend Analysis
Visualize your data in real-time to diagnose stability issues or tune loops.
* **Real-time Graphing:** Select specific registers to plot values instantly.
* **PID Tuning Helper:** Perfect for visualizing PV (Process Variable), SP (Setpoint), and OP (Output) simultaneously.
* **Dynamic Theme:** Charts automatically adapt to Dark Mode.

### 🔍 Auto Detection Wizard
Stop guessing your connection settings. This feature brute-forces combinations to automatically detect the correct parameters for your Modbus RTU device.
* **COM Port:** Select your target port.
* **Scan Range:** Define the Device ID range to probe.
* **Parameters:** Automatically cycles through Baud Rates, Parities, Data Bits, and Stop Bits.

### 🔌 Modbus RTU Scanner
Once your connection is established, use the RTU Scanner to visualize data.
* **Relaxed Timing:** Now supports **1.5 Stop Bits** for improved stability with Arduino/Embedded devices.
* **Control:** Write directly to registers from the interface.
* **Visuals:** Combine consecutive registers (Normal / Reverse) for 32-bit values.

---

### 🌐 Modbus TCP Scanner
Connect to and diagnose Modbus TCP devices over a network.
* **Connection:** Localhost or target IP (Default Port 502).
* **Flexibility:** Custom polling rates and Start / End address ranges.
* **Data Formatting:** Combined registers in Normal or Reverse order.

---

### 🎮 Modbus Simulation
Need to test a SCADA or HMI client? Spin up a virtual device instantly.
* **Robust Engine:** Completely rewritten threaded engine to prevent stalls.
* **Manual Overrides:** Writing to a register now "Locks" the value (indicated by `[LOCKED]`), preventing the auto-generator from overwriting your test data.
* **Simulation:** Generates valid Modbus responses for client testing.
