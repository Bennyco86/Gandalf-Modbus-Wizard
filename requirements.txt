Why these specific libraries?
pymodbus==2.5.3: Required because your code uses pymodbus.server.sync (which was removed in newer versions).

pyserial: Needed for serial.tools.list_ports in your scanners.

minimalmodbus: Your auto_detection_wizard.py relies heavily on this.

Pillow: Used in GandalfModbusWizard.py to handle the .ico icon file.

XlsxWriter: Used in modbus_scanner_base.py to export those nice Excel trend charts.

pyinstaller: Needed to build the .exe.
